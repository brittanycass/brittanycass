👩🏾‍💻 About Me






  Hi, my name is Brittany Casseus and I'm an ethusiastic and motivated individual starting my journey in the field of Informational Technology. While I am at the beginning of my career, I have a strong desire and passion for technology and a keen interest in helping others solve their technical issues. I have spent over 10 years in the Healthcare field and I pride myself on excellent customer service, providing empathy, helping others by solving problems and creating a seamless call flow. I have started to feel like I wanted to do more besides being in Healthcare, and after research and many talks with loved ones I realized my deep love for technology and I fell in love with the field. It aligns with my strengths and passions and offers endless opportunites for growth. I have been actively learning about troubleshooting hardware and software problems,maintaining network security, diagnosing and resolving complex technical problems and Im committed to developing my skills in these area's.
 
   I thrive in fast paced environments and I'm eager to bring my positive attitude, willingness to learn and dedication to providing excellent customer service to the team.My goal is to leverage my technical skills and customer service experience to contribute to a dynamic I.T. Support team, to gain hands-on experience and grow my expertise, contributing to a team where I can support users and ensure smooth I.T. operations.
